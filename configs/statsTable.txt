# reflect what they correspond to, but you can assign them different names. By default:
# Strength makes you more likely to land heavy attacks and boosts your max health

# Intellect does absolutely nothing except boosting max mana (WIP)
# Please also include abbreviations for the stats (For combat)

# affect any calculations, 
# EXCEPT for what is by default called "Keen Eye", that will always boost gold
# earned from combat by applying this formula: finalGold = gold * (1 + Keen Eye level * 0.7)
# This stat has to be included FIRST, and may have a name other than "Keen Eye"
