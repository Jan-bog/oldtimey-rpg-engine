# Available special attacks type (precisely ONE HAS to be declared):
# # BasicFoe - no special attacks
# # MultiAttacker - has a special attack where it strikes multiple times
# # # Uncomment (remove #) "attacksWhenMultiAttacking" and set it if choosing the above type
# # ArmourShredder - has a special attack that scales player's armour by a specified percentage for a turn, e.g. if the player has 100 armour, the value of 75 will result in (100 * 0.75) = 75 armour for the round. You can also go above 100 to grant player more armour, if you choose to
# # # Uncomment "armourShredVal" and set it if choosing the above type
# # ArmourBooster - similar to ArmourShredder, except applies the armour% to itself rather than player. I.e, if this foe has 100 armour and the value is 150, for the next round, it would have 150 armour
# # # Uncomment "armourBoostVal" for the above type
