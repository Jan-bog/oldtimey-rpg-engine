# Items need to be stored in the following way:
# [item's ID] [type of item] [name of item] [description (can be left as [])] [price to buy (or -1 if can't be traded)]
# Then, depending on the type of item:
# if it's a weapon, add: [1H (or 2H)] [minimum damage] [maximum damage] [stat that it scales with] [weapon (or shield)]
# in case of shields, minimum and maximum damage refer to how much damage they are capable of blocking per attack
# if it's armour, add: [armour slot (needs to correspond to an entry in armourSlotsConfig.txt)] [armour bonus]
#
# At the end of whatever item, unless it's junk or quest item, you can add stat boons, such as:
# [Subterfuge+1] or [Strength-1]. You can stack them, too! (without the comma)
# You can also impose stat requirements in a similar way (also after required parameters), such as:
# [Dexterity>15] or [Willpower<10]. Stacking possible as well
#
# Allowed types of items: junk, quest, weapon (shields are counted as weapons), armour, trinket, neck
#
# You can also start a line here with # to comment it out
