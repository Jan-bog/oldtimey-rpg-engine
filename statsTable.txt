# Now, some basics. Here, you can re-define how some words are displayed,
# such as "level" (maybe you want "age", or "mastery"),
# "health" (maybe you'd prefer "structural integrity"), etc etc
# Change the lines that don't begin with # to have them reflected in the game
# Level

# Experience

# Abbreviation for experience

# These next three stats determine some important things, so their description should
# reflect what they correspond to, but you can assign them different names. By default:
# Strength makes you more likely to land heavy attacks and boosts your max health
# Dexterity makes you more likely to land quick attacks and boosts crit chance
# Intellect does absolutely nothing except boosting max mana (WIP)
# Please also include abbreviations for the stats (For combat)
#
Strength
STR
boosts your max health and accuracy of your strong attacks
Dexterity
DEX
boosts your critical-strike chance and accuracy of your quick attacks
Intellect
INT
boosts your max mana and your spell power (WIP, useless to pick)
#
# The following stats can have their own descriptions, as they don't directly
# affect any calculations, 
# EXCEPT for what is by default called "Keen Eye", that will always boost gold
# earned from combat by applying this formula: finalGold = gold * (1 + Keen Eye level * 0.7)
# This stat has to be included FIRST, and may have a name other than "Keen Eye"
# Please include descriptions below each talent name
# Please include at MOST six talents (not counting strength/dex/int)
# If for whatever reason you don't wish to provide a description,
# Please still include an empty line
